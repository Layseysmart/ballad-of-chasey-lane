# Hey. 
# This script allows you not to delete files permanently, but compresses the deleted files and moves them to a special folder. 
# Then you have 7 days to restore them, after this period the files will be deleted permanently.
# How to install on unix system:
1. Move script REC.sh to your directory ~/bin/ and rename it to REC
2. Make script executable with chmod +x ~/bin/REC
3. Add ~/bin to your PATH, add to your ~/.profile the line PATH=$PATH: ~/bin
4. Run source ~/.profile to apply changes

# Good luck!
